## Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**chrisduhh/chrisduhh** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Data Visualisation (Sept 2024) and working on my carreer.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning at Zuyd University of Applied Science where I'm choosing my minors mostly in Cyber Security.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything interesting for me to learn more about Cyber Security.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with above.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my hobbies and my interests.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: you'll probably already know if you ended up here.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Either He/Him or They/Them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I super duper love animals.
